## Redux Framework

## ATTENTION ##
While we recognize Redux could be embedded in a theme or plugin in the past, we are no longer supporting the practice. 
Too many developers are not keeping their Redux code up-to-date (which could easily accomplished with Composer).
When users of the projects experience issues, they seek support from us,
which we are unable to provide short of suggesting they contact the project author (you) and ask you to update your vendor code.
This puts your users in the middle, and we'd prefer not to do that anymore.

Consequently, the vendor support plugin/extension for `ace_editor` has been discontinued.
The ACE Editor will load exclusively via CDN.
If your project requires a local installation of the ACE Editor JavaScript (whose size is substantial),
please include it in your project and use the `redux/<opt_name>/fields/ace/script` filter to specify the URL to that script.
The `ace_editor` field will use that URL to enqueue the ACE library.

Thank you for your kind attention in this matter.

## What's new in version 4? ##

### Core Rewrite
Our code base has been rebuilt from the ground up. With compartmentalized code, autoload, and class inheritance, Redux is now faster and more efficient than it's ever been!

### Top of the Line Security!
Redux meets security standards laid out by WordPress Coding Standards, WordPress VIP Standards, and ThemeForest Guidelines.  Focus includes escaping, sanitizing, nonces verification, and database query prep/caching.

### Automatic Google Font Updates.
This is one of the crown jewels of Redux v4!  Your users will have the ability to update Google Fonts as updates are available or automatic ‘behind the scenes’ updates.  No more waiting for updates and no API key is required!

### Field Sanitizing
Field sanitizing allows one to pass an array of function names as an argument to a field in which the return value will be the sanitizing string.  This feature will only work with text-based fields, including text, textarea, and multi_text (ACE Editor and WP Editor not included).

One may use any existing function, including PHP functions, WordPress functions, and custom-written functions.  The return value of any used function must be that of a string.  Any other return value will be disregarded.

Please view the [sample-config.php](https://github.com/reduxframework/redux-framework/blob/master/sample/sample-config.php) file for specific examples.

### Select2 AJAX Loading
The AJAX loading routines for the select2 fields have been fixed/finished.  See the 'capabilities' field in the demo panel for an example.  

In the interim, this feature will only work when used in conjunction with the `data` argument (that is, the one that fetches WordPress data).  

To set AJAX loading, add the `'ajax' => true` argument to your select field.  The `min_input_length` argument may also be added to specify how many characters should be typed before results are shown.  The default is `1`.

### Field/Section Disabling
This feature has been requested quite a few times over the years.  Fields and sections can now be disabled by adding the `'disabled' => true` argument to either a section or a field.  The section or field will then appear 'greyed out' and not respond to input.  This comes in handy in the event one may want to offer teasers for premium versions of their products.

Since those with a little CSS know-how could easily reactivate disabled fields with a little CSS, we took the added precaution of having Redux remove any `name` attributes on disabled fields/sections.  This way, even if a clever user reactivates the field, it will never save.

### Updated Panel Interface
The option panel interface has been brought up to date with the current WordPress admin design.  It is also now ‘theme aware.’  Panel colors will now follow suit with the selected admin theme.

### Improved Field Validation
Due to the need for multiple field validations, Redux now supports an array of validations versus the previously limiting single argument.  Validation results now appear in real time after a save without the need for a page refresh.

### Full v3 Backward Compatibility
We take backward compatibility very seriously here and strive to maintain it.  Redux v4 has been designed to act as a drop-in replacement to offer new functionality without breaking existing functionality.

## FAQs ##

1. Why should we use ```require_once``` instead of ```get_template_part```?
* First, because ```get_template_part``` is for... you guessed it, themes! Redux is designed to work with both themes *and* plugins.
* Second, read [this](https://kovshenin.com/2013/get_template_part/).
2. Why shouldn't we edit ```sample-config.php``` in the plugin directory?
* Because ```sample-config.php``` will be replaced at each update of the plugin. You will lose all your work.
