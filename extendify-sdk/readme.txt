* Browser
* Referring site
* Category selection
* WP language
* Active theme
* Active plugins
* Anonymized UUID
* Anonymized IP address

By activating the Extendify plugin and accessing the library, you agree to our [privacy policy](https://extendify.com/privacy-policy) and [terms of service](https://extendify.com/terms-of-service).
